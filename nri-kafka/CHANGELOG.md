# Unreleased next version

- In order to prevent accidental API changes, we force data in redis API to
  implement the HasExamples TypeClass from the nri-test-encoding package. (thanks @stoeffel / #82)

# 0.1.0.0

- First release, but we've battle-tested it against significant load for months now!
  Hope you enjoy
